*I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow ([What Works Hub for Global Education](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/what-works-hub-global-education)) at Oxford University. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Education from Columbia University. Previously, I obtained a B.A. in Economics and an M.A. in Economic Analysis from Universidad de Chile.*

*My research interests lie at the intersection of education and labor economics.
I'm particularly interested in implementing quantitative causal inference methods to study segregation and inequality in the educational system. Also, I'm keen on using administrative data aiming to better understand the impact of education on long-term results, such as labor outcomes and social mobility.  
Additionally, I am interested in the study of algorithm systems that support decision-making processes and their consequences on equity and fairness.*
