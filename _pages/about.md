*I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Education from Columbia University. Previously, I obtained a B.A. in Economics and an M.A. in Economic Analysis from Universidad de Chile.*

*My research interests lie at the intersection of education and labor economics.
I'm particularly interested in implementing quantitative causal inference methods to study segregation and inequality in the educational system. Also, I'm keen on using administrative data to better understand education's impact on long-term results, such as labor outcomes and social mobility.  
Additionally, I am interested in studying algorithm systems that support decision-making processes and their consequences on equity and fairness.*
