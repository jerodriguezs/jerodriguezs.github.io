*I'm a Ph.D. student in Economics and Education at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I obtained a B.A. in Economics and an M.A. in Economic Analysis from Universidad de Chile.*

*I'm interested in implementing quantitative causal inference methods to study segregation and inequality in the educational system. Also, I'm keen on using administrative data aiming to better understand the impact of education on long-term results, such as labor outcomes and social mobility.*
