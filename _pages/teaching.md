- ***Quantitative Methods for Evaluating Education Policies and Programs*** (*Prof. P. Bergman, Spring 2020 and 2021*)  
  This advanced masterâ€™s course addresses a key issue in evaluating education programs and policies: determining whether a policy causes an impact on student trajectories that would not have occurred in absence of the policy. The course will cover experimental and quasi-experimental techniques used to attribute causal relationships between educational programs and student outcomes, for the most part using methods from economics and econometrics.

- ***Data Analysis for Policy and Decision Making II*** (*Prof. J. Matsudaira, Fall 2019 and 2020*)  
  This is an intermediate-level course in statistical methods useful for policy analysis and evidence-based decision-making across a wide number of domains. Its primary objectives are to a) familiarize students with the relevant statistical underpinnings of several commonly used empirical tools; b) learn basic data management and coding skills for implementing large scale data analysis projects; c) gain experience in implementing appropriate data analyses for several common types of policy questions; and d) learn data visualization and presentation skills to effectively communicate the results of analyses to policy makers.
