## Instructor - Columbia University

- ***Data Analysis for Policy and Decision Making II*** (*Spring 2022*)  
  This is an intermediate-level course in non-experimental quantitative research methods, especially those related to education policy. The class examines such topics as residual analysis, modeling non-linear relationships and interactions using regression, logistic regression, missing data analyses, multilevel models, and principal components analysis. The course interweaves several concepts: framing research questions; using moderately advanced statistical approaches; learning to manipulate a large-scale longitudinal database; designing empirical tests to examine policy issues with appropriate statistical techniques; and interpreting and conveying research results to diverse audiences.

## Teaching Assistant - Columbia University

- ***Quantitative Methods for Evaluating Education Policies and Programs*** (*Prof. Peter Bergman, Spring 2020 & 2021*)
<!---
  This advanced masterâ€™s course addresses a key issue in evaluating education programs and policies: determining whether a policy causes an impact on student trajectories that would not have occurred in absence of the policy. The course covers experimental and quasi-experimental techniques used to attribute causal relationships between educational programs and student outcomes, for the most part using methods from economics and econometrics.
